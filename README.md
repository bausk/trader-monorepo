# Trader-Monorepo

## What is this?

Trader-Monorepo is a third iteration of my Python and ML-based custom trading terminal,
an experiment in building a rather data-intensive fullstack application to prove a hypothesis for algorithmic cryptocurrency trading.

## What does it do?

It is being developed to have a full-fledged trading terminal web application, and three backends:
ETL (Extract-Transform-Load), Backtesting and Trading.

## What data sources are supported?

I have implementations that read data from Cryptowatch and kuna.io, and can write data
(i.e. perform actual, livewire, fully unattended algorithmic trading) to kuna.io.

## Can I reproduce it or contribute?

Not yet, but probably yes somewhere in 2020Q3. This project isn't even in alpha, it needs its goals and system design figured out
before it can have any public attention.

Currently it's basically a very flaky hypothesis proving testbed with no compatibility in any direction.
